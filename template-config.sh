# instance.

# --- General settings

source $POLYPOCKET/default-config.sh
# Name of this server
#  Try to stick to [A-Za-z0-9] to prevent issues.

# --- Server binaries
# Path to this instance's server binary, relative to the
#  local start.sh script - should be a jar file.
export SERVER_JAR=Paperclip.jar

#  The script will update $SERVER_JAR from this file
#  every time it starts
export UPSTREAM_SERVER_JAR=~minecraft/bin/Paperclip.jar

# --- Plugin distribution
# Path to the plugins folder of this instance, relative to
#  the local start.sh script - usually ./plugins/

# The Java -Xmx maxiumum memory allocated to the server binary
export MAX_MEMORY=4G
# Whether previous instances that may still be running should
#  be killed if a process id file is found in the local

#  circumstances kill unrelated processes that have the same
#  PID as a previous server process that did not exit cleanly,
#   but also doesn't exist any more.
