# Flags in order:
# Set servername system property, actually for easy identification in htop
# Use new G1 Garbage Collector, better performance and all than default
# Limit GC pauses to prevent lag spikes on GC
# Required for RemoteToolkit apparently
# Use UTF-8 as default encoding - solves issues with config files and basically everything
# Limit memory allocation
